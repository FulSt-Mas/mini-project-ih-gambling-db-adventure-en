-- How to Handle This in Excel
-- Use Pivot Tables
-- Select your data range.
-- Insert a Pivot Table.
-- Set CustomerGroup as the rows and use Count on the CustomerGroup to show the number of customers in each group.

SELECT c.*, a.CurrencyCode

-- In Excel,VLOOKUP function or Power Query to merge data from two tables
-- Using VLOOKUP:
-- Ensure both tables are sorted based on CustId.
-- Use the formula in a new column in the customer table:
-- AccountTableRange is the range where the account data is located.
-- ColumnNumberForCurrencyCode is the column number in AccountTableRange that contains CurrencyCode.

-- How to Handle This in Excel
-- In Excel, handling a larger dataset typically involves a Pivot Table. Hereâ€™s how you can create a similar report:

-- Prepare Data:

-- Ensure you have a consolidated table where both betting information and product details are combined, possibly using a VLOOKUP or Power Query.
-- Create a Pivot Table:

-- Select the entire data table.
-- Insert a Pivot Table.
-- Use BetDate as the Rows and ProductFamily as a second-level row or column field.
-- Use SUM on Bet_Amt as the values to aggregate by product and date.
-- Customize the Pivot Table:

-- Drill down or filter by specific dates or products as needed.
